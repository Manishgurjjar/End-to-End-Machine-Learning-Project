# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project
This project shows how to build a machine learning system from start to finish. It uses a real-world housing dataset (usually California housing prices) and walks through each step a data scientist or ML engineer would follow:

Steps Explained:
1.Look at the Data
Understand what the data is about. For example, if the dataset is about houses, it includes info like number of rooms, location, price, etc.

2.Visualize the Data
Make charts and graphs to spot trends or unusual data.

3.Clean the Data
Fix missing or bad information, convert text into numbers, and get it ready for a machine learning model.

4.Build a Pipeline
Create a step-by-step recipe so the same data-cleaning steps can be used every time.

5.Train a Model
Let the computer learn from the data so it can make predictions (like guessing house prices).

6.Test the Model
Check how well the model is doing with data it hasnâ€™t seen before.

7.Tune the Model
Make adjustments to get even better results.

8.Save the Model
So it can be used later without re-training.
